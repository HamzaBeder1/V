# MIPS_Processor

## Description
The purpose of this project is to create a small implementation of the MIPS ISA using Verilog. A Harvard architecture will be used with separate instruction and data memories.
The sizes of the memories are limited, which is why byte addressing is not used.

The following MIPS instructions will be executed in this project:
* add
* sub
* addi
* addu
* subu
* and
* or
* andi
* ori
* sll
* srl
* beq
* bne
* bgt
* blt
* slt
* j
* jr
* jal
