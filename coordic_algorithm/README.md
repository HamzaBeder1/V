General-Purpose CORDIC Algorithm on Basys3 Board.
------
This project implements the CORDIC Algorithm; CORDIC is a hardware-efficient algorithm that is used to compute trigonometric and hyperbolic functions.

To use this project, click the T17 button to walk through the states used to implement this algorithm. The 7-segment display will display values to show what state
the machine is currently on:
